## Loading phyloseq objects into ampvis2
You will first have to extract the OTU-table and the metadata from the phyloseq object, and then import as normal with `amp_load`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ampvis2)
#Combine OTU abundance table and taxonomy table from the phyloseq object "my_phyloseq_object":
obj <- my_phyloseq_object
otutable <- data.frame(OTU = rownames(phyloseq::otu_table(obj)@.Data),
                       phyloseq::otu_table(obj)@.Data,
                       phyloseq::tax_table(obj)@.Data,
                       check.names = FALSE
                       )

#Extract metadata from the phyloseq object:
metadata <- data.frame(phyloseq::sample_data(obj), 
                       check.names = FALSE
                       )

#Load the data with amp_load:
my_ampvis2_object <- amp_load(otutable, metadata)
```
